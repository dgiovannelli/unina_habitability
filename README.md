Introductory class in Microbial Metabolism and Planetary Habitability for graduate students pursuing a Master Degree in Biology of Extreme Environments in the Astrobiology curricula. The class explores the planetary effects of microbial metabolism, and how these can be harnessed for geoengineering and terraforming. The student are expected to spend 70% of the class actively working of projects and the are required to participate in a final project where they make a terraforming plan for their planetary body of interest.

In the repository you'll find the different version of the class relative to each academic year. I always try to improve the class material year on year, so I suggest if interested to use the latest available year.
